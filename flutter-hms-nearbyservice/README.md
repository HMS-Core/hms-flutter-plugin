Nearby Data Communication allows devices to easily discover nearby devices and set up communication with them using technologies such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. The plugin provides Nearby Connection and Nearby Message APIs provided by the **HUAWEI Nearby Service SDK**.

- Nearby Connection

    Discovers devices and sets up secure communication channels with them without connecting to the Internet and transfers byte arrays, files, and streams to them; supports seamless nearby interactions, such as multi-player gaming, real-time collaboration, resource broadcasting, and content sharing.

- Nearby Message

    Allows message publishing and subscription between nearby devices that are connected to the Internet. A subscriber (app) can obtain the message content from the cloud service based on the sharing code broadcast by a publisher (beacon or another app).
