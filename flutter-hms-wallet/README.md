Huawei Wallet Kit is an open capability that integrates Huawei's full-stack "chip-device-cloud" technologies to provide digital passes such as cards (including ID cards), coupons, tickets and keys on an integrated platform. It enables users to add their tickets, boarding passes, loyalty cards, coupons, gift cards, and other cards or passes on their mobile phones for convenient, anytime use. It also facilitates interactions between apps and users through location-based notifications, and real-time status updates.
