### Additional Topics

#### Game Sign-in Requirements

- To implement the Game Sign-in function  for players to sign in to your game using Huawei IDs please use the [Huawei Account Flutter Plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/huawei_account) plugin. After the user successfully signs in, Huawei Account Kit sends the verification result to your game and you can obtain the player information by calling the related APIs from Players Client.

#### Testing Game Features

You need to have a tester account to perform the testing of some Game Features. For details about how to create a tester account, please refer to [Managing Tester Accounts](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/distribution/app/agc-tester_account_mgt?ha_source=hms1).

Before a game is released, you can use a tester account to sign in to the game and test the game achievements, leaderboards, and saved games. Avoid releasing achievements or leaderboards when the corresponding game is still undergoing tests. This is because achievement or leaderboard data changes along with game operations performed by the tester account, and it cannot be reset once they have been released.

Note that Huawei AppAssistant can display achievements, leaderboards, and saved games only after your game is released and only on devices running EMUI 10.0 or later and Huawei AppAssistant 10.3 or later is installed. (Huawei AppAssistant 10.1 or later for achievements).
